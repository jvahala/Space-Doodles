abstract = {An unmanned system for automatically 3-axis attitude determination by star constellation matching is a very useful tool for applications primary in the field of satellite technology, where stars are visible all the time. A special designed CCD camera system, which is sensitive enough to detect stars, points to the direction (attitude) to be determinated and captures stars within the camera field of view (fov). By comparing this imaged star pattern with celestial coordinates out of a database-like star catalogue, a star pattern can be matched and the attitude (3-axis) can be calculated by using simple vector algebra. In partnership with other attitude determination systems, the accuracy and reliability for an attitude control system is increasing. Including camera hardware and image processing software, we realized a transputer based (Inmos T8XX, Occam, Parallel C) onboard computer system for our own satellite missions. For terrestrial and ground based pointing applications or post-mission attitude determination a powerful PC-based system (Pentium, Pascal, C) is available with additional visualization features of certain steps during the image processing via an userfriendly desktop.},
