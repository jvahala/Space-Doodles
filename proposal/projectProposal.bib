abstract = {An unmanned system for automatically 3-axis attitude determination by star constellation matching is a very useful tool for applications primary in the field of satellite technology, where stars are visible all the time. A special designed CCD camera system, which is sensitive enough to detect stars, points to the direction (attitude) to be determinated and captures stars within the camera field of view (fov). By comparing this imaged star pattern with celestial coordinates out of a database-like star catalogue, a star pattern can be matched and the attitude (3-axis) can be calculated by using simple vector algebra. In partnership with other attitude determination systems, the accuracy and reliability for an attitude control system is increasing. Including camera hardware and image processing software, we realized a transputer based (Inmos T8XX, Occam, Parallel C) onboard computer system for our own satellite missions. For terrestrial and ground based pointing applications or post-mission attitude determination a powerful PC-based system (Pentium, Pascal, C) is available with additional visualization features of certain steps during the image processing via an userfriendly desktop.},

@article{Unser1993a,
abstract = {This paper describes a set of efficient filtering techniques for the processing and representation of signals in terms of continuous B-spline basis functions. We first consider the problem of determining the spline coefficients for an exact signal interpolation (direct B-spline transform). The reverse operation is the signal reconstruction from its spline coefficients with an optional zooming factor m (indirect B-spline transform). We derive general expressions for the z transforms and the equivalent continuous impulse responses of B-spline interpolators of order n. We present simple techniques for signal differentiation and filtering in the transformed domain. We then derive recursive filters that efficiently solve the problems of smoothing spline and least squares approximations. The smoothing spline technique approximates a signal with a complete set of coefficients subject to certain regularization or smoothness constraints. The least squares approach, on the other hand, uses a reduced number of B-spline coefficients with equally spaced nodes; this technique is in many ways analogous to the application of antialiasing low-pass filter prior to decimation in order to represent a signal correctly with a reduced number of samples.},

@article{Unser1993b,
abstract = {This paper describes a class of recursive filtering algorithms for the efficient implementation of B-spline interpolation and approximation techniques. In terms of simplicity of realization and reduction of computational complexity, these algorithms compare favorably with conventional matrix approaches. A filtering interpretation (low-pass filter followed by an exact polynomial spline interpolator) of smoothing spline and least squares approximation methods is proposed. These techniques are applied to the design of digital filters for cubic spline signal processing. An efficient implementation of a smoothing spline edge detector is proposed. It is also shown how to construct a cubic spline image pyramid that minimizes the loss of information in passage from one resolution level to the next. In terms of common measures of fidelity (e.g., visual quality, SNR), this data structure appears to be superior to the widely used Gaussian/Laplacian pyramid.},
