abstract = {The classical matrix Procrustes problem seeks an$\backslash$northogonal matrix which most closely transforms a$\backslash$ngiven matrix into a second matrix. We consider the$\backslash$nProcrustes problem in which the requirement that the$\backslash$ncolumns of the transforming matrix be orthonormal is$\backslash$nrelaxed to orthogonality. Closed form solutions$\backslash$ncannot be found, but numerical schemes to find the$\backslash$nbest matrix (in the Frobenius norm) are advanced.$\backslash$nNumerical examples are given and the of the$\backslash$northogonal Procrustes matrix alternative to Lowdin$\backslash$northogonalization is discussed.},

abstract = {After decades of using only one map projection, the Polyconic, for its mapping program, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) now uses several of the more common projections for its published maps. For larger scale maps, including topographic quadrangles and the State Base Map Series, conformal projections such as the Transverse Mercator and the Lambert Conformal Conic are used. Equal-area and equidistant projections appear in the National Atlas. Other projections, such as the Miller Cylindrical and the Van der Grinten, are chosen occasionally for convenience, sometimes making use of existing base maps prepared by others. Some projections treat the Earth only as a sphere, others as either ellipsoid or sphere. The USGS has also conceived and designed several new projections, including the Space Oblique Mercator, the first map projection designed to permit mapping of the Earth continuously from a satellite with low distortion. The mapping of extraterrestrial bodies has resulted in the use of standard projections in completely new settings. Several other projections which have not been used by the USGS are frequently of interest to the cartographic public. With increased computerization, it is important to realize that rectangular coordinates for all these projections may be mathematically calculated with formulas which would have seemed too complicated in the past, but which now may be programmed routinely, especially if aided by numerical examples. A discussion of appearance, usage, and history is given together with both forward and inverse equations for each projection involved.},

@article{Suzuki1985,
abstract = {Two border following algorithms are proposed for the topological analysis of digitized binary images. The first one determines the surroundness relations among the borders of a binary image. Since the outer borders and the hole borders have a one-to-one correspondence to the connected components of 1-pixels and to the holes, respectively, the proposed algorithm yields a representation of a binary image, from which one can extract some sort of features without reconstructing the image. The second algorithm, which is a modified version of the first, follows only the outermost borders (i.e., the outer borders which are not surrounded by holes). These algorithms can be effectively used in component counting, shrinking, and topological structural analysis of binary images, when a sequential digital computer is used.},
