Sending pictures to the stars!

Creators: Devin Conathan, Joshua Vahala

Constellations can be found all throughout the skies, and anyone can point at some stars at say that they, together, look like something special. Before now, it was quite difficult to do the opposite: choose something special, then find stars to match it! 

See the full project report for an explanation of how this is done and results from stellar matching.
